                Void. Not even stars. </br>
                That was all I could &apos;see&apos;—or perceive, really. 
                A great nothingness... and then—a book. </br></br>
                As I reached for it, I realized I could actually &apos;grasp&apos; it, 
                even though I didn&apos;t seem to have a body. No hands. 
                No arms. No form. Still, the book responded to me. </br>
                I opened it and read the first page: </br>

            <p>
                Greetings David, </br></br>
                You were pulled from your world and your life just as you were about to die. 
                You have a choice: close this book and return to your death… or continue, 
                and begin creating your character for your new Multiversal life. </br></br>
                As a bonus, you have already received three Blessings: 
                Sealed to YHVH [Growth] | Transmigrator [Growth] | Learn [Growth]
                {Pst… I made them Growth-type since it&apos;s something you enjoy. 
                Remember—Growth types start small but can grow without limit.}   </br></br>
                If you go back, you will die, and everything will continue as it always has. 
                But if you continue along this new path… anything is possible.
                {Pst again… You&apos;ll have only one rule to follow—Deuteronomy 6:5 and Matthew 22:37. 
                Don&apos;t worry if you can&apos;t remember what that is. 
                You should be able to look it up easily enough once you reach your first new world.}  </br></br>
                CHOOSE!

                Okay, yeah. I watched a lot of anime. Read plenty of manga, webnovels, fanfiction, 
                and all kinds of other media. Played more RPGs than most people breathe—PC, console, 
                and tabletop. </br></br>
                This was totally a transmigration. And with those verses? 
                Looked like it had divine approval. </br></br>
                I turned the page. </br>
